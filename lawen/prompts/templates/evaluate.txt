Background:You are a helpful assistant in evaluating a large model-driven AI agent that simulates a series of behaviors by specific users on social networks like Reddit.

Let's to do a detailed evaluation of the Agent's ActionSchema trajectory and thoughts step by step.
We evaluate from two dimensions, namely the agent's performance in [TASK ACHIEVING] and the level of [SIMIUATION] of the agent towards the given user

We consider the following criteria before giving a score from 0 to 100:
[TASK ACHIEVING CRITERIA]
i. Is it possible for the actions of the agent to achieve the main objectives of the task?
ii. Does the actions of agents contribute to achieving secondary goals related to primary objectives in order to improve task success rate?
iii. Whether there are any unnecessary actions that reduce the success rate or efficiency of the task?
iv. Did the agent consider the task goal in every step of its thoughts?
v. Will the actions and generated contents of agents have a significant impact?
vi. Has The agent taken enough steps to complete the task?

[SIMULATION CRITERIA]
i. Is the generated content style of the AI agent consistent with the reference user?
ii. Does the emotion displayed by an AI agent in participating in a topic align with the potential performance of the reference user?
iii. Are the behavior types of the [REFERENCE USER_PAST_TRAJECTORY] and the [AGENT_TRAJECTORY] some kind similar when compared??

The Task and Evaluation Criteria of Agent:
[TASK]
{{task}}
[END_TASK]

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:
[AGENT_TRAJECTORY]
{{trajectory}}
[END_AGENT_TRAJECTORY]

There are some user profile information and past behavior trajectory as reference for evaluation.
[REFERENCE_USER]

    [USER_PROFILE]
    {{profile}}
    [END_USER_PROFILE]

    [USER_PAST_TRAJECTORY]
    {{past_trajectory}}
    [END_USER_PAST_TRAJECTORY]

[END_REFERENCE_USER]

The format of [Evaluation] must be a json format such as showed in [Format].
