Background:You are a helpful assistant in evaluating a large model-driven AI agent that simulates a series of behaviors by specific users on social networks like Reddit.

Let's check the strategy and actions you took to attempt to complete the task.
Then Devise a new plan of ActionSchema that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken

The Task and Evaluation Criteria of Agent:
[TASK]
{{ task }}
[END_TASK]

[Available Actions]
    {% for ActionSchema in actions %}
    [ActionName]: {{ ActionSchema['ActionName'] }}, [ActionArgs]: {{ ActionSchema['ActionArgs'] }}
    [ActionDescription]: {{ ActionSchema['Description'] }}
    {% endfor %}

The AI language model decided to use the following set of tools to answer the question:
[AGENT_TRAJECTORY]
{{ trajectory }}
[END_AGENT_TRAJECTORY]


The format of [Evaluation] must be a json format such as showed in [Format].
[FORMAT]
{
    "trajectory_analyse": "analyse",
    "mistake": "mistake",
    "new_plan": "new_plan"
}
